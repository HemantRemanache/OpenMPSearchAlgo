# OpenMPSearchAlgo
Searching a two digit number in a 1000 * 1000 matrix using OpenMP 
a large two-dimensional array of size [1000,1000] filled with single digit numbers between 0 to 9
task is to implement a parallel solution using OpenMP and MPI that search for a two-digit number, can be hard coded. The search will be horizontal, vertical, diagonal, and counter diagonal from left to right and up to down.
tested code with a 10 x 10 array
